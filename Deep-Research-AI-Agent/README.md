# Deep-Research-AI-Agent

A dual-agent AI system that performs deep web research using LangChain, LangGraph, and Tavily API. Designed for structured research workflows — from crawling sources to generating final written answers.

🚀 Features 🌐 Web Research Agent: Uses Tavily to collect online data.

✍️ Writer Agent: Summarizes and generates a final answer from research.

🔁 Agent Coordination: Managed using LangGraph for controlled step-by-step execution.

🧱 LangChain Framework: Agents built modularly using LangChain tools.

🖥️ Streamlit UI (optional): Easy-to-use interface to run and view results.

🛠️ Setup Instructions

Clone the Repo bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-research-agent.git cd deep-research-agent
Create Virtual Environment & Activate bash Copy Edit python -m venv agent agent\Scripts\activate # Windows
💻 Usage ▶️ Option 1: Run with Streamlit bash Copy Edit streamlit run app.py Then open the browser to interactively ask questions and view responses.

▶️ Option 2: Run CLI Tool bash Copy Edit python main.py You’ll be prompted to enter a topic or a URL. The agents will run and generate a summary.

📌 Notes Designed to modularly support more agents in the future.

State transitions and outputs are handled cleanly via LangGraph.

Streamlit interface is optional but enhances usability for demos or non-dev users.
