# -Rice-Grain-Classification-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning
This project aims to build an image classification system that can accurately classify different types of rice grains using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model leverages transfer learning to adapt pre-trained networks for rice grain classification. The project also includes a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Classify different types of rice grains using deep learning.
- 
- **Approach**:
  - Preprocess and explore the rice grain dataset.
  - Utilize a pre-trained CNN (VGG16) with transfer learning.
  - Evaluate model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimization.
  - Deploy a Gradio-based UI for live image classification.
