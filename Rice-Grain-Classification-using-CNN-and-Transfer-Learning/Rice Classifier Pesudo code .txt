# Step 1: Data Preparation
Load rice grain image dataset
Preprocess images (resize, normalize, augment)
Split dataset into training, validation, and test sets

# Step 2: Model Building
Load a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet50 or VGG16)
Freeze base layers to retain learned features
Replace top layers:
    - Global Average Pooling
    - Fully Connected (Dense) layer(s)
    - Output layer with Softmax activation (number of rice classes)

# Step 3: Model Compilation
Compile model:
    - Loss: categorical_crossentropy
    - Optimizer: Adam (or others during tuning)
    - Metrics: accuracy

# Step 4: Model Training
Train model on training set
Validate model on validation set
Monitor training and validation loss/accuracy

# Step 5: Hyperparameter Tuning
Tune:
    - Learning rate
    - Batch size
    - Number of layers unfrozen
    - Optimizer choice
Select best performing model

# Step 6: Model Evaluation
Evaluate model on test set
Calculate and display:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1-score
    - Confusion Matrix (optional)

# Step 7: Save Model
Save the final trained model to disk (e.g., .h5 or .keras)

# Step 8: User Interface (UI) Development
Build a simple UI (Streamlit or Web)
Allow user to:
    - Upload rice grain image
    - Preprocess uploaded image
    - Load saved model
    - Predict rice grain type
    - Display prediction and confidence scores

# Step 9: End
