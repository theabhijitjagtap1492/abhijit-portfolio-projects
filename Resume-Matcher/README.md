# üìÑ Resume & Job Description Matcher

This is a Streamlit web application that helps you match a resume to a job description based on skill overlap. It calculates a match score, shows which skills from the job description are present in the resume, and which are missing.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Skill-Based Matching**: Compares the resume and job description based on a predefined list of skills.
- **Match Score**: Calculates a score from 0 to 10 based on how many required skills are met.
- **Detailed Feedback**: Lists the specific skills that matched and those that are missing.
- **Fit for Role**: Provides a simple "Yes" or "No" recommendation based on the score.
- **File Upload**: Supports uploading both the resume and job description as PDF files.

## üîß How It Works

The application works as follows:
1.  **PDF Extraction**: Text is extracted from the uploaded PDF files.
2.  **Skill Extraction**: A predefined list of common skills is used to find which skills are mentioned in the job description and the resume.
3.  **Scoring**: A score is calculated based on the ratio of matched skills to the total skills required in the job description.
4.  **Feedback Generation**: The app generates feedback detailing the matched skills, missing skills, and a final "Fit for Role" assessment.
